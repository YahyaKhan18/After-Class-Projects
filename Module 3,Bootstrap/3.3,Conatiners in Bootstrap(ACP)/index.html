    <div class="container bg-success">The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful,
    muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is
    traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.</div><br>

    <div class="container-fluid bg-success">Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in
    the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent
    and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates, which it takes by ambush.</div><br>

    <div class="container-breakpoint bg-success">Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are locally extinct
    in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger's range is
    severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, as its range is thought to
    have declined by 53% to 68% since the late 1990s. Major threats to tigers are habitat destruction and fragmentation due
    to deforestation, poaching for fur and the illegal trade of body parts for medicinal purposes.</div>
